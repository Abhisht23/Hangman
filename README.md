# Hangman
A game made by me during my +1. It was a good experience back then to work on something cool like this. 
The game is semi-graphical like my previous projects. The user needs to use the keys to navigate and click on enter to accept or as shown on the screen.
There's a help option too. User can check it out for details about the game.
